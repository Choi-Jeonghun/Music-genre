<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music" target="_blank" title="hip hop"><h2>Hip Hop</h2></a>
<strong><u>Hip hop</u></strong> or <strong><u>hip-hop</u></strong> is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans,
<br> Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx, New York City.
<br> The origin of the name is often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx.
<br> While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (including rap), hip hop is characterized four key elements:
<br> <strong>"rapping"</strong> (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); <strong>DJing</strong> (and turntablism),
<br> which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); <strong>b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing</strong> (movement/dance); and <strong>graffiti</strong>.
<br> Other elements are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical);
<br> beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others.
<br> The fifth element, although debated, is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion, or beatboxing.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues" target="_blank" title="Rhythm and Blues"><h2>R&B</h2></a>
<strong>Rhythm and blues</strong>, abbreviated as <strong>R&B</strong>, is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s.
<br>The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans,
<br> at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular.
<br> In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums,
<br> one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists.
<br> R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy,
<br> as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, economics, and aspirations.
